Here are 2 tools related to Commodore emulation.

makeat64: read a number of PRG, P00 and/or T64 files and pack their contents
          into a T64
fixconv: fix corrupt T64 files (invalid end address) "another program called
         CONV64 was on the scene, and it created faulty T64 files. The ending
         load address was usually set to $C3C6 regardless of file size. Be
         aware that these files are still quite common on the Web and FTP
         sites" (from Peter Schepers' document of T64)

To compile, you need to copy some files from WAV-PRG sources:
from common_core:
  block_list.c
  block_list.h
  program_block.h
  wavprg_types.h
from cmdline:
  process_input_files.c
  process_input_files.h
from wav2prg_core:
  checksum_state.h
  create_t64.c
  create_t64.h
  wav2prg_block_list.c
  wav2prg_block_list.h
from prg2wav_core:
  prg2wav_utils.c
  prg2wav_utils.h
  t64utils.c
  t64utils.h

Then, type "make makeat64" or "make fixconv" to build the tools
